 A Gamified Pomodoro Timer Web Application

## Why a Pomodoro Timer?
I found that pomodoro timers were a very helpful productivity tool for me, but the motivation to start that timer was the hardest part.
This app attempts to mimic systems in popular modern gacha games by motivating you with rolls at the end of each pomodoro round similar to how those games use daily rewards that allow you to roll for characters you want.

## Quick Start
The web app is hosted here: [https://jasond20.github.io/Playdoro/](Playdoro)

## Usage
Timer functions should be apparent, start to start timer, stop to stop timer, and reset to reset timer.
At the end of each timer cycle a wheel will be spun automatically reward you with break time (and more goodies in future updates).
The wheel follows similar probability to those of modern gacha games with a "3-star" being very common, "4-star" being somewhat rare, and "5-star" being exceptionally rare.

## Contributing
Feel free to suggest improvements that would help your workflow, interactibility, and motivation for using this tool!

## TODO
- Improve frontend UI
- refine rewards for each roll for collecting characters, allotting break time for a game, etc.
- Implement settings to change time, amount of sessions, control colours/themes, etc.
